# Reproducible Science

Slides originally created for OceanHackWeek 2019 on doing reproducible science in the context of increasing digitization, since expanded and generalized for use outside of teaching contexts. These slides do not purport to be a be-all end-all solution for reproducible science, and should be taken as recommendations.

These slides have an oceanography and Python focus, but could be adapted to fit other contexts.

The slides are freely available for use under CC-BY-4.0, go ahead and share them!
